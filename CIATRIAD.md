CIA TRIAD

CIA Triad

While studying this subject I first learned the meaning of CIA in cybersecurity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Confidentiality means that the information exchanged between two users must remain private and protected from unauthorized access. One way to accomplish this is by using encryption. Another method is to apply access control, making sure that only the right people can see certain data. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is also a strong way to guarantee confidentiality.

Integrity ensures that the information is accurate and has not been altered in transit or storage. A common way to achieve integrity is through hashing, which allows the system to verify that the message has not been modified. Digital signatures and certificates add an extra layer, confirming that the sender is authentic and that the data was not tampered with. This is also related to non-repudiation, which means that the sender cannot later deny having sent the message.

Availability makes sure that systems and data are always accessible to authorized users when needed. This means preventing downtime caused by failures or attacks. Techniques such as redundancy (using multiple servers/components), regular patching (to fix vulnerabilities), and strong monitoring are key to ensuring availability.
